## Examples

Here are three examples of how to use HARAnalyzer:

### Example 1: Basic usage

```
from haranalyzer import HARAnalyzer
```

# Initialize the analyzer with your .har file and the main website URL
```
analyzer = HARAnalyzer(har_file_path='path_to_your_file.har', main_website='https://www.your-website.com')
```

# Extract API calls

```
api_calls = analyzer.analyze()
```

# Print API calls

```
for call in api_calls:
    print(call)
```

### Example 2: Using strict authentication mode

```
from haranalyzer import HARAnalyzer
```

# Initialize the analyzer with your .har file, the main website URL, and set auth_mode to 'strict'

```
analyzer = HARAnalyzer(har_file_path='path_to_your_file.har', main_website='https://www.your-website.com', auth_mode='strict')
```

# Extract API calls

```
api_calls = analyzer.analyze()
```

# Print API calls

```
for call in api_calls:
    print(call)
```

### Example 3: Saving output to a file

```
from haranalyzer import HARAnalyzer
```

# Initialize the analyzer with your .har file and the main website URL

```
analyzer = HARAnalyzer(har_file_path='path_to_your_file.har', main_website='https://www.your-website.com')
```

# Extract API calls

```
api_calls = analyzer.analyze()
```

# Save the output to a file

```
analyzer.save_output_to_file(output_path='path_to_your_output_file.json', entries=api_calls)
```
